Allows users to view the performance of a specific stock over time by displaying a graph of its price movements. Users can also buy and sell stocks through the application, using virtual currency to simulate real-world trading. The application keeps track of users' trading history, including all completed trades and their associated details.

In addition to displaying users' current holdings, the application also includes a personal portfolio feature that allows users to see a summary of all the stocks they own. The portfolio displays each stock's current value, as well as its overall performance since it was purchased.

To use the application, users must first register and create an account. This is done through a login and registration system that stores user information in a database. Once they have an account, users can log in to access the application's features.
